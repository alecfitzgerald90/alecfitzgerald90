### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Alec Fitzgerald and as I write this, I'm currently in my 3rd year at East Tennessee State University majoring in computing and I'm 32 years old(no, it's never too late to go back to school). My grandmother was going to school up into her late 60's. I'm actually writing this README for a server side web programming class and I'm pretty sure it's going to be graded ðŸ˜Ÿ. 

  I just started an internship as a web developer using python and django at a company called WaterIQ Technoligies which may turn into a full time job at the end of this summer ðŸ¤ž. This company is one of the world leaders in environmentally friendly algea remediation. Pretty interesting and complex stuff how they do it. I've always heard that you learn way more on the job than you do in school and I'm finding that to be true. Learning a lot there.
  
  Fun fact: Recent studies show that around 70% of coding jobs have nothing to do with technology at all!! ðŸ’©
